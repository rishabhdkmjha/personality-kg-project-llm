`# Report: LLM-Powered Personality Knowledge Graph Construction

This report details the design choices, implementation methodology, and evaluation framework for a system that constructs a personality-focused knowledge graph from unstructured text using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Section 1: Foundational Framework

### 1.1 The Rationale for Knowledge Graphs

The task of modeling human personality requires a data structure that can capture complex, interconnected information. Unlike traditional relational databases, which store data in rigid tables, a **Knowledge Graph (KG)** represents information as a network of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).[3, 4, 5] This structure is ideal for personality modeling because it allows for the representation of nuanced connections, such as a person exhibiting a behavior that, in turn, indicates a specific personality trait.[6] The atomic unit of a KG is the **triple**—a subject, predicate, and object—which forms a simple yet powerful way to codify facts.[7, 8, 9]

### 1.2 The Big Five (OCEAN) Model

To structure the abstract concept of personality, this project adopts the **Big Five model (OCEAN)**, the most widely recognized framework in personality psychology.[10, 1, 2] It defines personality along five dimensions: **O**penness, **C**onscientiousness, **E**xtroversion, **A**greeableness, and **N**euroticism.[11, 1] Each of these primary traits is composed of more granular **facets** (e.g., 'Self-discipline' is a facet of Conscientiousness), creating a hierarchical structure that is perfectly suited for a graph model.[12]

### 1.3 Ontology Design

The ontology serves as the schema for our KG, defining the allowed types of nodes and relationships. This provides a crucial constraint for the LLM's extraction process, ensuring consistency.

| Node Label | Description |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Person` | An individual entity mentioned in the text. |
| `PersonalityTrait` | One of the five core OCEAN traits. |
| `TraitFacet` | A specific facet of a core trait. |
| `BehavioralIndicator` | A specific action or statement from the text. |

| Edge Type | Description |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `EXHIBITS` | Links a `Person` to a `BehavioralIndicator`. |
| `INDICATES` | Links a `BehavioralIndicator` to a `TraitFacet`. |
| `IS_FACET_OF` | Connects a `TraitFacet` to a `PersonalityTrait`. |

## Section 2: Methodology and Implementation

### 2.1 Data Strategy: Synthetic Data Generation

Given the two-day timeframe, acquiring and annotating a real-world dataset was infeasible. Therefore, a **synthetic data generation** strategy was employed. An LLM was used in two stages:
1.  **Creative Writer:** Prompted to generate short narratives about characters with specific Big Five personality profiles.
2.  **Expert Annotator:** Prompted to read the generated stories and extract the "ground truth" knowledge triples according to the defined ontology.

This approach provided a perfectly labeled dataset for both development and evaluation.[13, 14]

### 2.2 Technology Stack

The technology stack was chosen to be powerful, accessible, and entirely free to use within a Google Colab environment.

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Ollama with Llama 3:** To avoid paid APIs, Ollama was used to run the powerful, open-source Llama 3 model locally within the Colab notebook. This provided the core natural language understanding capabilities for the project.
*   **LangChain:** This framework was used to orchestrate the LLM. Its `LLMGraphTransformer` was particularly useful for converting unstructured text into structured graph documents based on a predefined schema.
*   **Neo4j AuraDB:** A free, cloud-hosted graph database was used for storing and visualizing the knowledge graph. This choice resolved the networking challenges of connecting a cloud-based Colab notebook to a local database instance.

### 2.3 Extraction Pipeline

The end-to-end pipeline was implemented in a Google Colab notebook and follows these steps:
1.  **Environment Setup:** The Colab runtime is configured to use a free **T4 GPU** to accelerate the LLM's processing speed.
2.  **Start Ollama Server:** The Ollama server is installed and started as a background process within the Colab instance.
3.  **LLM Extraction:** The synthetic text is passed to the `LLMGraphTransformer`, which uses the running Llama 3 model to extract nodes and relationships that conform to the `allowed_nodes` and `allowed_relationships` defined in the ontology.
4.  **Graph Population:** The extracted graph data is loaded into the Neo4j AuraDB instance using the `add_graph_documents` method.

## Section 3: Evaluation Framework

A robust evaluation requires both quantitative and qualitative methods.[15, 16]

### 3.1 Quantitative Evaluation

The accuracy of the triple extraction process can be measured using standard metrics by comparing the LLM's output against the "ground truth" synthetic annotations.[17, 18]

*   **Precision:** Measures the proportion of extracted triples that are correct. A high precision indicates the system avoids generating false information.[19, 20]
*   **Recall:** Measures the proportion of all correct triples that the system successfully extracted. A high recall indicates the system is comprehensive.[19]
*   **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single, balanced score.[21]

### 3.2 Qualitative Evaluation

Quantitative scores alone are insufficient, as LLMs can produce plausible but incorrect information ("hallucinations").[22, 17] A qualitative evaluation is necessary:

*   **Manual Inspection:** Using the Neo4j Browser, a human can visually inspect the graph to check for logical inconsistencies or incorrect relationships.
*   **Correctness and Grounding:** Manually tracing a sample of extracted relationships back to the source text to ensure they are factually supported and not fabricated by the LLM.

## Section 4: Limitations and Future Directions

### 4.1 Limitations

*   **Dependency on Synthetic Data:** The system was developed and evaluated on a small, clean, synthetic dataset. Its performance on noisy, real-world text is unknown.
*   **Zero-Shot Prompting Brittleness:** The extraction relies on a zero-shot prompt. Performance can be sensitive to the prompt's phrasing and may vary between different LLM versions.[23, 24]
*   **Entity Disambiguation:** The current pipeline does not include an explicit step for entity disambiguation (e.g., merging "Bob" and "Mr. Smith"). In a larger document, this would lead to a fragmented graph.[25, 26, 27]

### 4.2 Future Work

*   **Fine-Tuning:** For higher accuracy and consistency, a smaller open-source model could be fine-tuned on a larger synthetic dataset specifically for the personality extraction task.[28, 29]
*   **Hybrid Architecture:** A more advanced pipeline could re-introduce a preliminary Named Entity Recognition (NER) step using a library like `spaCy` to efficiently identify simple entities like person names before passing the text to the more powerful LLM for complex relationship extraction.
*   **GraphRAG Application:** The constructed knowledge graph could serve as the knowledge base for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. This would allow a user to ask complex, natural language questions about a person's personality, with the system retrieving evidence from the graph to synthesize a grounded and explainable answer.[30, 31, 32]`
